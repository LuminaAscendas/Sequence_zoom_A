		slide_Title: 'A nuclear power plant includes the reactor core, where controlled fission creates heat. This heat is used to turn water into steam. The steam drives a turbine which in turn drives a generator. In the process, nuclear energy is converted to heat (thermal energy), which is converted to mechanical energy and then to electricity. Approximately two-thirds of all nuclear power plants in the United States are of this type.'
